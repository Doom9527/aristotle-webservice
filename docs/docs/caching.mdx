Aristotle is designed to be serving over hundreds of millions of nodes and links. One challenge for supporting the
CRUD of the data in such a scale is the efficient _expand_ operation common in knowledge graph, because such operation
over sufficiently large dataset often results in

1. Long-running query
2. Timed-out query (due to out-of-memory error)

This section discusses how Aristotle handles the two cases above.

Handling Long-Running Queries
-----------------------------

Under a high load when data is massive, even small subgraph expansion could post high pressure on the database,
resulting slower queries for such cases. Aristotle offers LRU cache mechanism that offers the optimal query time for
most frequently queries subgraph. Although we are aware that great tools such as
[Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) or [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) cache are there for us, 
since Aristotle is Spring-based, for this type of caching we use
[Spring Cache](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/io/caching.html) as the transparent caching mechanism on all
read operations. 

### Enabling LRU Cache

The cache is enabled by default. To disable it, simply set `read-cache.enabled` [configuration](./configuration) to
`false`. Here is the example for disabling the cache in
[application.yaml](https://github.com/paion-data/aristotle/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yaml)

```yaml
read-cache:
  enabled: false
```

### Configuring LRU Cache

Cache size can be adjusted in terms of memory allocation or number of items cached. To bound the cache based on memory
size, use `read-cache.size` [configuration](./configuration):

```yaml
read-cache:
  enabled: true
  size: 500MB
```

:::info[Size Unit]

The acceptable memory size units are:

- KB
- MB
- GB

Specifying all others will result in a configuration error

:::

To restrict the number of cache entries instead, use `read-cache.num-subgraphs`:

```yaml
read-cache:
  enabled: true
  num-subgraphs: 5000
```

:::warning

Specifying both `read-cache.size` and `read-cache.num-subgraphs` is a configuration error and fails the Aristotle
startup

:::

Timed-Out Queries
-----------------

For the second type of issue, we pre-compute expand subgraph in a separate microservice, called
[mega-mover](https://github.com/paion-data/mega-mover/) and load the subgraph as the cache into Redis.

:::tip

Mega Mover is still under development and its documentation will be available once done.
